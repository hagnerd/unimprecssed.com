Hi ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to Unimprecssed. A blog about CSS. You might be wondering who
*I* am, and why
*I'm* writing about CSS.

## Who am I?
My name is Matt Hagner. I'm a self taught developer who has been programming for
a little over a year. 

I mainly use React because it fits my mental model the
best.

I use tools like CSS-in-JS because they feel more ergonomic than a single global style sheet, and less isolated/more reusable than css modules. 

I also suck at CSS! But I'm hoping to get better.

## Why am I writing about CSS?

I've noticed that a lot of front end developers struggle with CSS, and there is
some tension between the *CSS* folk and the *JS* folk. I'm hoping to help bridge
that gap by showing you that you can use both in tandem to make some really cool
stuff. 

I think itâ€™s important to understand the underlying technology, and to fully grasp the tools within our CSS tool belts to make us effective at the layout and styling of our components, apps, and websites. 

You don't need to be a wizard at both to be effective, but you do have to be comfortable
reaching into other disciplines every once in a while.

## Who is this blog for?

Do you find CSS to sometimes be unintuitive and confusing? So do I!

Do you find yourself adding and removing random CSS properties until you get the desired
effect without any clue why it suddenly worked? So do I!

Do you wonder about the usefulness of CSS-in-JS? So do I! 

_Admittedly, I'm already sold on it, but I'd love to explore it further to find out if the
abstraction and added overhead are **really** worth it._

Do you want to build modern looking, and feeling, applications? So do I!

## Ready?

Letâ€™s explore CSS in its current, and potential future states together in a positive environment.
