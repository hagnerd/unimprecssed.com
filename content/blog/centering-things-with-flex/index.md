title: Centering things with flex

Centering things with CSS can be frustrating üò§. It seems like such a simple thing,
and something that _everyone_ should know. So surely, you think to yourself, I
know exactly how to do it. 

I'll just add `margin: auto;`! And you do. And the element you applied
it is horizontally centered, but not veritcally centered.

__*What in the actual hell?*__

You start adding every centering property you can remember. `float`s, `align-self`s, `text-align`s. You've created a frankenstein and nothing
is working how you wanted it to.

__*What went wrong?*__

The reason `margin: auto;` didn't work is because it wasn't designed that
way. For some strange reason while working on CSS2.1 it was decided that a bunch
of arbitrary rules for collapsing the height of elements with `margin:auto;` was
a good idea.

__*How do we fix this then?*__

## Say hi üëã to Flexbox

Flexbox can be scary if you haven't worked with it very much. There are quite a few flex specific properties. But the good news is, that _most_ use
cases are pretty easy. So easy that the next time you have to align some stuff,
you'll probably reach for it.

### Basics
When working with flexbox there are two types of elements:
1. Parent
2. Children

A üí™ parent is any element with `display: flex;`.  

A üí™ child is any **direct** child of flex parent.

The flex children are the elements that get aligned. The flex parent provides a safe space
for the children to do their thing.

Just like your parents, are someone elses children, flex children, can be
another elements flex parent.

#### Step 1) Don't forget to flex 

First we set up our container with `display: flex;`.

```html

<style>
  .container {
    /* not related to flex, just to give an outline */
    border: 1px solid red;

    display: flex;
  }

  .child {
    /* not related to flex, just to give an outline */
    border: 1px solid green;
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<div class="container">

  <div class="child" />

</div>

```

The default behavior when only `display: flex;` is set, is for the flex children
to be added across the horizontal axis. In our case, we are only working with
one element, so it isn't a big concern.

#### Step 2) Slide to the left, slide to the right

Now let's make it horizontally aligned. Baby steps.

```css
  .container {
    /* ... */
    justify-content: center;
  }

```

We add `justify-content: center;` to the flex parent. The `justify-content`
property is used for setting the alignment of the children across the main axis. 

In flexbox the main axis is the same axis that the content is added across. By
default items are added from left to right across the width, or horizontal axis,
of the screen. 

`justify-content` can take a few other values, but I'll leave those for another
time üòâ.

#### Step 3) "There's so much room for activities"

Now onto vertical alignment. This is a little trickier with CSS because of
those darn CSS2 decisions regarding height, and margin. We need to explicitly
set `height` on our parent container. This is what allows us the space to center
our child within.

```css
  .container {
    /* ... */

    height: 500px;
  }

```

Remember that if the container height is 0, or smaller than the height of the children, then you can't vertically align the child.

#### Step 4) Center yourself  

Finally. We can vertically align our element. 

```css
  .container {
    /* ... */
    align-items: center;
  }

```

We set the property `align-items` to center on our flex parent. Now the element
is vertically and horizontally centered. üëç

There are of course some caveats. This will probably __not__ work the way you want it to if
the parent has more than one direct child. Having all of your elements
bunched together in the direct center of the screen is probably not what you
want. 

You can also acheive a centered element by doing the following:

```css
  .container {
    /* ... */
    display: flex;
    height: 500px;
  }

  .child {
    /* ... */

    margin: auto;
  }

```

Why does adding `margin: auto;` suddenly work when applied to a child of a flex
parent? Flexbox is a more modern part of CSS and was designed to combat some of
the more strange decisions in CSS.  

Setting any of the `margin-*` properties to auto on a flex child will push the child element the
furthest it can be from the opposite side. For example, `margin-left: auto;`
would push the child element to the right side of the screen. `margin-top: auto;` would push it to the bottom.

Setting `margin: auto;` sets all of the margin properties to auto, resulting in
a perfectly centered element.

So what did we learn today?

* Flexbox allows you to quickly, and easily center an element, or group of elements
* `margin: auto;` does not work the same way vertically, that it does
horizontally except when it does 
* CSS doesn't have to be scary
